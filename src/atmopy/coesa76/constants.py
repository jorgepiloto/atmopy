of successive layers characterized by successive segments of the adopted
temperature height-function for this Standard. The fifth value, Z_11, is the
reference height for the atomic hydrogen calculation, while the sixth value,
Z_12, represents the top of the region for which the tabular values of the
Standard are given. These six values if Z_b, along with the designation of the
type of temperature-height function associated with the first four of these
values, plus the related value of L_Kb, for the two segments having a linear
temperature-height function, are listed in table 5. """
